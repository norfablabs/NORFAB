# NORFAB Python API

The NORFAB Python API provides a programmatic interface to interact with the NORFAB automation fabric. It is designed for developers who want to integrate NORFAB capabilities into their Python applications for advanced network automation and management tasks.

NorFab Python API can be used to interact with automations fabric. To start working with Python API need to import `NorFab` object and instantiate it.

```
from norfab.core.nfapi import NorFab

nf = NorFab(inventory="./inventory.yaml")
nf.start()
nf.destroy()
```

Refer to [Getting Started](norfab_getting_started.md) section on 
how to construct  `inventory.yaml` file.

All interaction with NorFab happens via client, to create a client need to call `make_client` method:

!!! example

    === "Direct Invocation"

        This example demonstrates steps to create NorFab instance, create client,
        run job and destroy NorFab instance.

        ```
        import pprint
        from norfab.core.nfapi import NorFab

        nf = NorFab(inventory="./inventory.yaml")
        nf.start()

        client = nf.make_client()

        result = nf.client.run_job(
            service="nornir",
            task="cli",
            kwargs={"commands": ["show version", "show clock"]}
        )

        pprint.pprint(result)

        nf.destroy()
        ```

    === "With Context Manager"

        Context manager simplifies code and handles client creation and NorFab cleanup.

        ```
        import pprint
        from norfab.core.nfapi import NorFab

        with NorFab(inventory="./inventory.yaml") as nf:
            result = nf.client.run_job(
                service="nornir",
                task="cli",
                kwargs={"commands": ["show version", "show clock"]}
            )

        pprint.pprint(result)
        ```

Calling `destroy` method will kill all the clients as well.
