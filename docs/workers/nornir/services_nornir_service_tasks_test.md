# Nornir Service Test Task

> task api name: `test`

The Nornir Service `test` task designed to facilitate the execution of network tests. This task provides network operations engineers and network automation developers with tools to validate network configurations, ensure compliance, and monitor network performance. By leveraging the capabilities of the Nornir service, users can automate testing process, identify issues proactively, and maintain a robust network infrastructure.

Nornir service `test` task uses Nornir [TestsProcessor](https://nornir-salt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Processors/TestsProcessor.html) to run the tests and support test suites definition in YAML format, where test suite YAML files can be stored on and sourced from broker.

## Nornir Test Sample Usage

Nornir service `test` task uses suites in YAML format to define tests, sample tests suite:

``` yaml title="suite_3.txt"
- name: Check ceos version
  task: "show version"
  test: contains
  pattern: "4.30.0F"
- name: Check NTP status
  test: ncontains
  pattern: "unsynchronised"
  task: "show ntp status"
- name: Check Mgmt Interface Status
  test: contains
  pattern: "is up, line protocol is up"
  task: "show interface management0" 
```

File `suite_3.txt` stored on broker and downloaded by Nornir service prior to running tests, below is an example of how to run the tests suite.

        Demo
		
		  ![Nornir Cli Demo](../../images/nornir_test_demo.gif)
    
        In this example:

        - `nfcli` command starts the NorFab Interactive Shell.
        - `nornir` command switches to the Nornir sub-shell.
        - `test` command switches to the `test` task sub-shell.
        - `suite` argument refers to a path for `suite_3.txt` file with a set of tests to run. 
        - Devices filtered using `FC` - "Filter Contains" Nornir hosts targeting filter to only run tests on devices that contain `spine` or `leaf` in their hostname.
		
        `inventory.yaml` should be located in same folder where we start nfcli, unless `nfcli -i path_to_inventory.yaml` flag used. Refer to [Getting Started](../../norfab_getting_started.md) section on how to construct  `inventory.yaml` file

## Formatting Tests Output

NorFab interactive shell allows you to format the results of network tests into text tables. This is particularly useful for presenting test results in a clear and organized manner, making it easier to analyze and interpret the data. The NorFab interactive shell supports the `table` command, which relies on the [tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/) module to generate text tables. By outputting test results in table format, you can quickly identify issues and take appropriate action.

## Using Jinja2 Templates to Generate Tests

Using Jinja2 Templates enables you to create dynamic test suites based on variables defined in your inventory or passed as job data. This approach allows you to tailor tests to specific devices or scenarios, ensuring that the tests are relevant and accurate. Jinja2 templates provide a powerful way to automate the creation of complex test cases, incorporating conditional logic, loops, and other advanced features to meet your testing requirements.

## Templating Tests with Inline Job Data

Inline Job Data allows you to define test parameters directly within the `job_data` argument, making it easy to customize tests on the fly. This feature is particularly useful for scenarios where test parameters need to be adjusted frequently or based on specific conditions. By templating tests with inline job data, you can ensure that your tests are always up-to-date and aligned with the current network state.

## Using Dry Run

The Using Dry Run feature allows you to generate the content of network test suites without actually performing any actions on the devices. This is useful for validation purposes, as it enables you to verify the correctness of your tests before running them. By using dry run, you can identify potential issues and make necessary adjustments, ensuring that your tests will execute successfully when run for real.

## Running a Subset of Tests

Running a Subset of Tests allows you to execute only a specific set of tests, rather than running the entire test suite. This is useful for targeted testing, such as validating changes in a particular part of the network configuration or focusing on specific devices features. By running a subset of tests, you can save time and resources, while still ensuring that critical aspects of the network are thoroughly tested.

## Returning Only Failed Tests

Returning only failed tests enables you to filter the test results to show only the tests that have failed. This is particularly useful for quickly identifying and addressing issues, as it allows you to focus on the areas that require attention. By returning only failed tests, you can streamline the troubleshooting process and ensure that network problems are resolved efficiently.

## NORFAB Nornir Test Shell Reference

The NORFAB Nornir Test Shell Reference provides a comprehensive set of command options for the Nornir `test` task. These commands allow you to control various aspects of the test execution, such as setting job timeouts, filtering devices, adding task details to results, and configuring retry mechanisms. By leveraging these command options, you can tailor the behavior of the tests to meet your specific network management needs, ensuring that your network remains reliable and performant.

NorFab shell supports these command options for Nornir `test` task:
