# Netbox Update Device Interfaces Task

> task api name: `update_device_interfaces`

The Netbox Update Device Interfaces Task is a feature of the NorFab Netbox Service that allows you to synchronize and update the interface data of your network devices in Netbox. This task ensures that the interface configurations in Netbox are accurate and up-to-date, reflecting the current state of your network infrastructure.

Keeping interface data accurate and up-to-date is crucial for effective network management. The Netbox Update Device Interfaces Task automates the process of updating interface information, such as interface names, statuses, mac addresses, and other relevant details.

## Branching Support

Update device interfaces task is branch aware and can push updates to the branch. [Netbox Branching Plugin](https://github.com/netboxlabs/netbox-branching) need to be installed on Netbox instance.

**How it works** - Netbox worker on a call to update interfaces task fetches live data from network devices using nominated datasource, by default it is Nornir service [parse](../nornir/services_nornir_service_tasks_parse.md) task using NAPALM `get_interfaces` getter. Once data retrieved from network, Netbox worker updates records in Netbox database for device interfaces.

![Netbox Update Device Interfaces](../../images/Netbox_Service_Update_Interfaces.jpg)

1. Client submits and on-demand request to NorFab Netbox worker to update device interfaces

2. Netbox worker sends job request to nominated datasource service to fetch live data from network devices

3. Datasource service fetches data from the network

4. Datasource returns devices interfaces data back to Netbox Service worker

5. Netbox worker processes device interfaces data and updates records in Netbox for requested devices

## Limitations

Datasource `nornir` uses NAPALM `get_interfaces` getter and as such only supports these device platforms:

- Arista EOS
- Cisco IOS
- Cisco IOSXR
- Cisco NXOS
- Juniper JUNOS
