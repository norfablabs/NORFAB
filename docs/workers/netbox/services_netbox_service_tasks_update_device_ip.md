# Netbox Update Device IP Task

> task api name: `update_device_ip`

The Netbox Update Device IP Task is a feature of the NorFab Netbox Service that allows you to synchronize and update the IP addresses data of your network devices in Netbox. This task ensures that the IP address records in Netbox are accurate and up-to-date, reflecting the current state of your network infrastructure.

**How it works** - Netbox worker on a call to update IP addresses task fetches live data from network devices using nominated datasource, by default it is Nornir service [parse](../nornir/services_nornir_service_tasks_parse.md) task using NAPALM `get_interfaces_ip` getter. Once data retrieved from network, Netbox worker updates records in Netbox database for device interfaces.

![Netbox Update Device Interfaces](../../images/Netbox_Service_Update_Interfaces.jpg)

1. Client submits and on-demand request to NorFab Netbox worker to update device IP addresses

2. Netbox worker sends job request to nominated datasource service to fetch live data from network devices

3. Datasource service fetches data from the network

4. Datasource returns devices IP addresses data back to Netbox Service worker

5. Netbox worker processes device data and updates or creates IP address records in Netbox for requested devices

## Branching Support

Update device IP task is branch aware and can push updates to the branch. [Netbox Branching Plugin](https://github.com/netboxlabs/netbox-branching) need to be installed on Netbox instance.

## Limitations

Datasource `nornir` uses NAPALM `get_interfaces_ip` getter and as such only supports these device platforms:

- Arista EOS
- Cisco IOS
- Cisco IOSXR
- Cisco NXOS
- Juniper JUNOS
