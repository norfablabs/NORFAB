# NorFab Overview

## What is NorFab?
NorFab (Network Automation Fabric) is a distributed task automation and orchestration framework designed for real-world network operations. It simplifies and accelerates network automation by integrating tools, delivering ready-to-use solutions, and enabling engineers to focus on outcomes rather than integration challenges.

## Key Features
- **Flexibility**: Supports centralized, distributed, and hybrid deployments.
- **Scalability**: Horizontally scalable with a brokered architecture.
- **Ease of Use**: Pythonic, CLI, REST, and model-driven interfaces.
- **Security**: Built-in encryption using CurveZMQ.
- **Reliability**: Persistent messaging and fault tolerance.
- **Extensibility**: Plugin ecosystem for custom protocols and workflows.

## Architecture
- **Clients**: Submit jobs and consume services.
- **Broker**: Routes jobs and manages services.
- **Workers**: Execute tasks and manage resources.
- **Resources**: Devices, databases, filesystems, etc.

## Services
### Network Automation Services
- **Nornir Service**: Automates network device operations using libraries like Netmiko and NAPALM.
- **Workflow Service**: YAML-based workflows for complex processes.
- **Agent Service**: AI-enhanced automation for compliance checks and fault detection.
- **Containerlab Service**: Manages containerized network topologies.

### Data Management Services
- **Netbox Service**: Synchronizes and updates network inventory data.

### REST API Services
- **FastAPI Service**: Provides REST API endpoints for integration with external systems.

## Deployment
### Local Deployment
1. Install NorFab using pip:
   ```
   pip install norfab
   pip install norfab[nfcli]
   pip install norfab[nornirservice]
   ```
2. Create the environment:
   ```
   nfcli --create-env norfab
   ```
3. Configure `inventory.yaml` for broker and workers.

### Docker Deployment
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/norfablabs/NORFAB.git norfab
   ```
2. Build and start Docker containers:
   ```
   cd norfab/docker/norfab-docker
   docker compose build
   docker compose start
   ```

## Why Choose NorFab?
- **Unified Platform**: Bridges disparate tools, teams, and technologies.
- **Future-Proof**: Adapts to evolving network needs.
- **Vendor-Neutral**: Manages multi-vendor environments seamlessly.
- **Model-Driven**: Ensures robust validation and documentation.

## Protocol
The NorFab Protocol (NFP) defines a reliable service-oriented request-reply dialog between clients, a broker, and workers. It supports presence, heartbeating, and persistent messaging, ensuring reliable communication even across network partitions.
